# Pagerank Project
================
Name: Seungho (Samuel) Lee
Date: 9/13/2020

This project involves creating a simple search engine, using the PageRank alogrithm with Power Iteration method, for a following website: `https://www.lawfareblog.com`.

The above website provides legal analysis on the U.S. national security issues.

## Task 1: the power method

Implement the `WebGraph.power_method` function in `pagerank.py` for computing the pagerank vector.

**Part 1:**
For initial assessment of my algorithm, I ran `pagerank.py` on the `small.csv.gz` graph, which yielded the following results:
```
In [1]: run pagerank.py --data=./small.csv.gz --verbose                      
DEBUG:root:computing indices
DEBUG:root:computing values
INFO:root:rank=0 pagerank=6.0257e-01 url=4
INFO:root:rank=1 pagerank=4.6414e-01 url=6
INFO:root:rank=2 pagerank=3.4544e-01 url=5
INFO:root:rank=3 pagerank=1.9498e-01 url=2
INFO:root:rank=4 pagerank=9.9210e-02 url=3
INFO:root:rank=5 pagerank=8.9347e-02 url=1
```

**Part 2:**
As expected, the `pagerank.py` file execution, along with an option `--search_query`, resulted in a similar output, with few different links. 

The following is my output:
```
In [2]: run pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz --search_query='corona'

```

**Part 3:**
The webgraph of lawfareblog.com (the P matrix) naturally contains a lot of structure.
For example, essentially all pages on the domain have links to the root page https://lawfareblog.com/  and similarly broad pages like https://www.lawfareblog.com/topics and https://www.lawfareblog.com/subscribe-lawfare.
These pages therefore have a large pagerank.
We can get a list of the pages with the largest pagerank by running

```
In [5]: run pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz

```

These pages are not very interesting, however, because they are not articles.
How can we find the most important articles?
The answer is to modify the P matrix by removing all links to non-article pages.

How do we know if a link is a non-article page?
This is a hard question to answer with 100% accuracy,
but there are many methods that get us most of the way there.
An easy method is to remove all pages that have "too many" links.
The `--filter_ratio` argument removes all pages that have more links than the specified fraction.
(If that short explanation doesn't make sense, that's okay.
You can either read the source for details or just accept that the option does magic.)

Using this option, we can estimate the most important articles on the domain with the following command:
```
In [6]: run pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz --filter_ratio=0.2       
DEBUG:root:computing indices

```

When Google calculates their P matrix for the web,
they use a similar process to modify the P matrix in order to reduce spam results.
The exact formula they use, however, is a jealously guarded secret.

In the case above, notice that we have removed the blog's most popular article (www.lawfareblog.com/snowden-revelations).
The blog editors believe that Snowden's revelations about NSA spying are so important that they link to the article on every single webpage in the domain,
and out "anti-spam" `--filter-ratio` argument removed this article from the list.
In general, it is a challenging open problem to remove spam from pagerank results,
and all current solutions rely on careful human tuning and still have lots of false positives and false negatives.

**Part 4:**
Recall from the reading that the runtime of pagerank depends heavily on the eigengap of the $\bar\bar P$ matrix,
and that this eigengap is bounded by the alpha parameter.

Run the following four commands:

1. `run pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose`
1. `run pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose --alpha=0.99999`
1. `run pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose --filter_ratio=0.2`
1. `run pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose --filter_ratio=0.2 --alpha=0.99999`

```

```
You should notice that the last command takes considerably more iterations to compute the pagerank vector.
(My code takes 685 iterations for this call, and about 10 iterations for all the others.)

This begs the question does the second command (with the `--alpha` option but without the `--filter_ratio`) option not take a long time to run?
The answer is that the P graph for www.lawfareblog.com naturally has a large eigengap and so is fast to compute for all alpha values,
but the modified graph does not have a large eigengap and so requires a small alpha for fast convergence.

Changing the value of alpha also gives us very different pagerank rankings.
For example, 
```
In [11]: run pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz --verbose --filter_ratio=0.2

Which of these rankings is better is entirely subjective,
and the only way to know if you have the "best" alpha for your application is to try several variations and see what is best.
If large alphas are good for your application, you can see that there is a tradeoff between quality answers and algorithmic runtime.
We'll be exploring this tradeoff more formally in class when we incorporate statistics into our discussion.

## Task 2: the personalization vector

The most interesting applications of pagerank involve the personalization vector.

**Part 1:**
Implement the `WebGraph.make_personalization_vector` function.
This function enables the `--personalization_vector_query` command line argument,
which provides an alternative method for searching by doing the filtering on the personalization vector.

If you've implemented the function correctly,
you should get results similar to:
```
In [13]: run pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz --filter_ratio=0.2 --personalization_vector_query='corona'

Which results are better?
That depends on what you mean by "better."
With the `--personalization_vector_query` option,
a webpage is important only if other coronavirus webpages also think it's important;
with the `--search_query` option,
a webpage is important if any other webpage thinks it's important.
You'll notice that in the later example, many of the webpages are about Congressional proceedings related to the coronavirus.
From a strictly coronavirus perspective, these are not very important webpages.
But in the broader context of national security, these are very important webpages.

Google engineers spend TONs of time fine-tuning their pagerank personalization vectors to remove spam webpages.
Exactly how they do this is another one of their secrets that they don't publicly talk about.

**Part 2:**
Another use of the `--personalization_vector_query` option is that we can find out what webpages are related to the coronavirus but don't directly mention the coronavirus.
This can be used to map out what types of topics are similar to the coronavirus.

For example, the following query ranks all webpages by their `corona` importance,
but removes webpages mentioning `corona` from the results.
```
In [15]: run pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz --filter_ratio=0.2 --personalization_vector_query='corona' --search_query='-corona'

```
You can see that there are many urls about concepts that are obviously related like "covid", "clinical trials", and "quarantine",
but this algorithm also finds articles about Chinese propaganda and Trump's policy decisions.
Both of these articles are highly relevant to coronavirus discussions,
but a simple keyword search for corona or related terms would not find these articles.

**Part 3:**
You should experiment with a national security topic other than the coronavirus.
For example, find out what articles are important to the `iran` topic but do not contain the word `iran`.
Your goal should be to discover what topics that www.lawfareblog.com considers to be related to the national security topic you choose.

## Submission

1. Create a new repo on github (not a fork of this repo).

1. Push your changes to the `pagerank.py` file into your repo.

1. Create a `README.md` file that contains the output of your program for each of the parts above.
   You may format the file however you like,
   and I recommend you choose something that recruiters will be impressed by.

1. Get at least 5 stars on your repo.
   (You made trade stars with other students in the class.)

   Recruiters use github profiles to determine who to hire,
   and pagerank is used to rank user profiles.
   Links in this graph correspond to who has starred/followed who's repo.
   By getting more stars on your repo, you'll be increasing your github pagerank, which increases the likelihood that recruiters will hire you.

   In some sense, we are doing a "dual problem" to data mining by getting these stars.
   Recruiters are using data mining to find out who the best people to recruit are,
   and we are hacking their data mining algorithms by making those algorithms select you instead of someone else.

1. Submit the url of your repo to sakai.

1. In the sakai submission, state which tasks you were able to complete.
   Each task is worth 2 points, and the homework is worth 14 points overall.
